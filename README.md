# SARA Shell

it  is a customised command line interface or a shell similar to the bash shell used in the the linux terminal by default. 

Developed using Python language for a college project submission, **SARA** shell aims at providing the work done by complex commands using simple and easy to learn commands. 

Currently being in development, it is a python file that can be pulled and tested in the LINUX terminal, as many python commands are not supported by windows.

Some basic commands developed till now are:
```
  usr       :      similar to the "whoami" command in bash shell 
  curdir    :      similar to the "pwd" command in bash shell 
  read      :      similar to the cat command in the bash shell 
  open      :      a mix of "touch" command and the command to open an existing file 
  ```
  and many more.
